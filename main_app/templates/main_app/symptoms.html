    <h2>Recognizing Symptoms, Understanding Prevention</h2>
    <p>Diabetes can be a silent disease, especially Type 2. Knowing the warning signs and, more importantly, understanding the steps you can take to prevent it are crucial for your long-term health. This page is divided into two parts: understanding the symptoms and a detailed guide to prevention.</p>

    <hr style="margin: 30px 0;">

    <h3>Part 1: Symptoms of Diabetes</h3>
    <p>The symptoms of diabetes are caused by high levels of glucose remaining in your blood. How these symptoms appear can be very different depending on the type.</p>

    <h4>Symptoms of Type 1 Diabetes: <strong>Fast & Obvious</strong></h4>
    <p>As we covered on the previous page, Type 1 is an autoimmune attack where insulin production stops. Because of this, the symptoms appear <strong>very quickly</strong> (over days or weeks) and are usually severe. It's a medical emergency.</p>
    <p>The main symptoms are often called the <strong>"4 T's"</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Toilet:</strong> Needing to urinate frequently, including waking up at night to go. This is because the body tries to flush out the excess sugar through the urine.</li>
        <li><strong>Thirsty:</strong> Extreme, unquenchable thirst. This is a direct result of losing so much water through urination.</li>
        <li><strong>Tired:</strong> Severe fatigue, weakness, and lack of energy. Your body's cells are being starved of the glucose they need for fuel.</li>
        <li><strong>Thinner:</strong> Rapid, unexplained weight loss. Your body can't use glucose for energy, so it starts breaking down its own fat and muscle for fuel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>If you or your child suddenly experience these symptoms, see a doctor immediately.</strong></p>

    <h4>Symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes: <strong>Slow & Silent</strong></h4>
    <p>This is why Type 2 is so dangerous. It develops slowly over many years as the body becomes more resistant to insulin. Symptoms can be so mild that they are easily ignored or dismissed as just "getting older." Many people have Type 2 diabetes for years without knowing it.</p>
    <p>Common signs include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Increased Thirst & Urination:</strong> This can be present, but it's often not as extreme as in Type 1. You might just notice you're drinking more water than you used to.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent Fatigue:</strong> A general, nagging tiredness that doesn't go away, even after sleeping.</li>
        <li><strong>Blurry Vision:</strong> High blood sugar can pull fluid from the lenses of your eyes, affecting your ability to focus. This can come and go.</li>
        <li><strong>Slow-Healing Sores:</strong> Cuts, scrapes, or blisters that take an unusually long time to heal.</li>
        <li><strong>Frequent Infections:</strong> High blood sugar can weaken your immune system. You may get more frequent yeast infections (in both men and women), urinary tract infections (UTIs), or skin infections.</li>
        <li><strong>Tingling or Numbness (Neuropathy):</strong> You might feel a "pins and needles" sensation, pain, or numbness in your hands or feet. This is a sign of nerve damage from high blood sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Areas of Darkened Skin:</strong> A condition called <i>Acanthosis Nigricans</i> can appear. These are dark, velvety patches of skin, usually in the folds of the neck, armpits, or groin. This is a strong physical sign of insulin resistance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> Do not wait for symptoms to appear. If you have any of the risk factors we listed on the previous page (family history, overweight, inactivity, etc.), you should get a simple blood test from your doctor to check your blood sugar.</p>

    <h3>Part 2: Prevention & Prediabetes</h3>
    <p>This is the most important part of this page. While you cannot prevent Type 1 diabetes, <strong>Type 2 diabetes is highly preventable</strong> in many cases. The key is understanding and reversing a condition called <strong>Prediabetes</strong>.</p>

    <h4>What is Prediabetes?</h4>
    <p>Prediabetes is the "yellow light" for Type 2. It means your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. It's a critical warning sign that your body's insulin resistance is increasing.</p>
    <p>The vast majority of people with prediabetes have <strong>no symptoms at all</strong>. You can only find it with a blood test. This condition is incredibly common, and most people who have it don't know it. The bad news? It puts you on a fast track to developing Type 2, heart disease, and stroke. The <strong>amazing news?</strong> It is often <strong>completely reversible</strong> with lifestyle changes.</p>

    <h4>A Detailed, Actionable Prevention Plan</h4>
    <p>You have the power to make changes that can prevent or delay Type 2 diabetes for decades, or even for life. Here are the most effective strategies, proven by science.</p>

    <h5>1. Achieve Moderate Weight Loss (If You Are Overweight)</h5>
    <p>This is the single most effective prevention strategy. You do not need to lose a huge amount of weight. Research shows that losing just <strong>5% to 7% of your body weight</strong> can cut your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by over 50%.
    <br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> If you weigh 90 kg, a 5% loss is only 4.5 kg. This is a small, achievable goal with a massive health payoff.</p>

    <h5>2. Get Active: Make Movement a Daily Habit</h5>
    <p>Exercise is like a magic key. When you are active, your muscles become much more sensitive to insulin (it reduces insulin resistance). This means your body needs less insulin to do its job.
    <br>
    <strong>The Goal:</strong> Aim for at least <strong>150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week</strong>.
    <br>
    <strong>What is "Moderate"?</strong> This means your heart rate is up, you're breathing a little harder, but you could still talk in short sentences. The easiest, cheapest, and most effective example is a <strong>brisk walk</strong>.
    <br>
    <strong>How to do it:</strong> Just 30 minutes, 5 days a week. You can even break it up into 10-minute walks three times a day. You don't need a gym. Just walk. Also, try not to sit for long periods. Get up and move around for a few minutes every hour.</p>

    <h5>3. Build a "Plate" for Prevention</h5>
    <p>This isn't a "diet." It's a way of eating for life. Instead of focusing on what you <i>can't</i> eat, focus on what you <i>can</i> add. We will cover this in more detail on the next page, but here is the core principle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fill Half Your Plate with Vegetables:</strong> Focus on non-starchy vegetables like spinach (palak), cauliflower, broccoli, tomatoes, cucumbers, and bell peppers. They are low in calories and high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Fiber helps you feel full and slows down sugar absorption.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill One Quarter with Lean Protein:</strong> Protein helps you feel full and satisfied. Good choices include dal, chickpeas (chana), beans (rajma), lentils, paneer, tofu, eggs, fish, and chicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill One Quarter with Whole Grains/Carbs:</strong> This is the part to watch. Choose "whole" carbohydrates, which have more fiber. This includes whole-wheat roti, brown rice, oats, and millets. The key is <strong>portion control</strong>. Keep this to one-quarter of your plate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>4. Ditch Sugary Drinks</h5>
    <p>This is a simple, high-impact change. Sugary drinks like sodas, fruit juices, sweet lassi, and sugary tea/coffee are "liquid sugar." They flood your body with sugar very quickly, which spikes your blood sugar and insulin, and they are a major source of empty calories that lead to weight gain.
    <br>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> Drink water. Unsweetened tea or coffee is also fine. If you want flavor, add a squeeze of lemon or mint to your water.</p>

    <h5>5. Know Your Numbers</h5>
    <p>You cannot change what you don't measure. If you are over 45, or if you are any age and have risk factors (like family history or being overweight), <strong>talk to your doctor</strong>. Ask for a simple blood test to check your blood sugar. Knowing you have prediabetes is a gift—it gives you the motivation and the chance to make these changes and protect your future health.</p>
