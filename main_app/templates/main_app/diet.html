    <h2>A Practical Guide to Healthy Eating</h2>
    <p>Let's clear this up first: a "diabetes diet" is not a special, restrictive, or boring diet. It is simply <strong>the healthiest way for everyone to eat.</strong> The goal is not to ban foods, but to build balanced, nutritious, and satisfying meals that help you manage your blood sugar, feel energized, and maintain a healthy weight.</p>
    <p>The single most important concept to learn is <strong>balance</strong>. This guide will give you practical tools to build that balance into every meal.</p>

    <h3>The Easiest Tool: The "Healthy Plate" Method</h3>
    <p>This is the best place to start because it's visual and requires no complicated counting. Forget about complex calorie math. Just picture your plate.</p>
    
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; flex-wrap: wrap; border: 2px solid #007bff; border-radius: 8px; padding: 15px; background: #f9f9f9;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px; padding-right: 20px;">
            <h4>Your Plate, Reimagined:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fill HALF (50%) of your plate with Non-Starchy Vegetables.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fill ONE QUARTER (25%) of your plate with Lean Protein.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fill ONE QUARTER (25%) of your plate with Complex Carbohydrates.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A balanced thali might be a large portion of spinach sabzi and a katori of cucumber salad (Half), a katori of dal or chana (Quarter), and one whole-wheat roti or a small katori of brown rice (Quarter).</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Let's break down each part of that plate.</p>

    <hr style="margin: 30px 0;">

    <h3>Part 1: The Carbohydrate Quarter (Your "Fuel")</h3>
    <p>This is the most important section to understand for diabetes, as carbohydrates have the biggest impact on your blood sugar. Carbs are not the enemy; they are your body's main source of fuel. The secret is in the <strong>Type</strong> and the <strong>Amount</strong>.</p>
    
    <h4>Choose <strong>"Simple" over "Complex"</strong> Carbs</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple Carbs (The "Fast" Sugar):</strong> These are foods like sugar, white bread, maida, white rice, biscuits, and sugary drinks. They have no fiber. Your body digests them very quickly, causing a rapid "spike" in your blood sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Carbs (The "Slow" Fuel):</strong> These are whole foods like whole-wheat roti/atta, brown rice, millets (jowar, bajra, ragi), oats, and legumes (like dal and beans). They are full of <strong>fiber</strong>. Fiber is a "superhero"—it slows down digestion, prevents the blood sugar "spike," and keeps you feeling full for longer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Myth-Busting: "Can I still eat Roti and Rice?"</h4>
    <p><strong>YES. Absolutely.</strong> This is the biggest myth, and it's simply wrong. You just need to be smart about it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The problem in a traditional Indian diet is not the rice or roti itself, but the <i>proportion</i>. Often, a meal is 75% rice/roti and 25% dal/sabzi. We need to flip this.</li>
        <li><strong>The Solution:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Control the Portion:</strong> Stick to the "Quarter Plate" rule. Have 1-2 small whole-wheat rotis instead of 4. Have one small katori of rice instead of a large mound.</li>
                <li><strong>Change the Type:</strong> Always choose whole-wheat (multigrain is even better) atta over maida. Choose brown rice over white rice. Brown rice has the fiber-rich bran intact, which slows sugar absorption.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance It:</strong> <strong>NEVER</strong> eat carbs alone. If you have rice, have it with a big portion of dal and sabzi. The protein and fiber from the other foods will help slow down the sugar spike from the rice.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Myth-Busting: "Are Fruits Banned?"</h4>
    <p><strong>NO. This is another sad and harmful myth.</strong> Whole fruits are fantastic for you. They are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
    <br>
    <strong>The Rule:</strong> <strong>Eat the whole fruit, don't drink the juice.</strong>
    <br>
    <strong>Why?</strong> Eating a whole apple is great. The fiber in the fruit's flesh slows down the release of its natural sugar (fructose). But when you <i>juice</i> that apple (even with "no added sugar"), you discard the fiber and are left with a glass of pure, concentrated sugar that will spike your blood sugar just as fast as a soda.
    <br>
    <strong>Good choices:</strong> Apples, berries (strawberries, blueberries), guavas, pears, and oranges are excellent.
    <br>
    <strong>Portion is key:</strong> Enjoy fruits, but don't eat a whole bowl at once. A single fruit at a time is a perfect, healthy snack.</p>

    <h3>Part 2: The Protein Quarter (Your "Building Blocks")</h3>
    <p>Protein is essential. It helps build muscle, repair your body, and—critically for diabetes—it makes you feel <strong>full and satisfied</strong>. Including protein in every meal helps you feel less hungry and reduces cravings for sugary snacks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Excellent Plant-Based Sources:</strong> This should be the core of your protein intake.
            <ul>
                <li>Dal (all kinds: toor, moong, masoor)</li>
                <li>Legumes (chana, rajma, chickpeas)</li>
                <li>Paneer (choose low-fat if possible)</li>
                <li>Tofu</li>
                <li>Soybeans / Soya Chunks</li>
                <li>Curd (dahi) and Greek Yogurt (unsweetened)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Excellent Animal-Based Sources:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Eggs (a perfect food)</li>
                <li>Chicken breast (not fried)</li>
                <li>Fish (especially fatty fish like salmon or mackerel, which have healthy fats)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr style="margin: 30px 0;">

    <h3>Part 3: The Vegetable Half (Your "Health Shield")</h3>
    <p>This is the section you should fill up without worry. Non-starchy vegetables are low in calories, low in carbs, and packed with the fiber, vitamins, and minerals your body needs to thrive.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What to Eat:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leafy Greens:</strong> Spinach (palak), fenugreek (methi), mustard greens (sarson), and all other greens are superstars. Eat them every day.</li>
                <li><strong>Cruciferous Veggies:</strong> Cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli.</li>
                <li><strong>Others:</strong> Tomatoes, cucumbers (kheera), bell peppers (capsicum), okra (bhindi), brinjal (baingan), bottle gourd (lauki), bitter gourd (karela).</li>
                <li><strong>Raw is great:</strong> A simple salad (kachumber) with your meal is a fantastic way to add fiber and fill up.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>A Note on Starchy Veggies:</strong> Vegetables like potatoes, corn, and peas are healthy, but they are higher in carbs. They should be considered part of your "Carbohydrate Quarter," not your "Vegetable Half."</li>
    </ul>

    <hr style="margin: 30px 0;">

    <h3>The Final, Most Important Rules</h3>

    <h4>1. <strong>Drink Water. Stop Drinking Sugar.</strong></h4>
    <p>This is the simplest, most powerful change you can make. Sugary drinks are a primary driver of insulin resistance and weight gain.
    <br>
    <strong>AVOID THESE:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Sodas (Coke, Pepsi, etc.)</li>
        <li>Packaged Fruit Juices (they are all sugar, even the 100% ones)</li>
        <li>Sugary Lassi</li>
        <li>Sugarcane Juice</li>
        <li>Energy Drinks</li>
        <li>Sweetened Tea & Coffee (reduce the sugar you add)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>CHOOSE THESE:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Water (your best friend)</li>
        <li>Unsweetened Tea / Green Tea</li>
        <li>Black Coffee (in moderation)</li>
        <li>Buttermilk (chaas) without added salt or sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. <strong>Beware of "Healthy" Fakes & Processed Foods</strong></h4>
    <p>Just because a package says "sugar-free," "baked," or "multigrain" doesn't mean it's healthy.
    <br>
    <strong>"Sugar-Free" Biscuits:</strong> These often have no sugar, but they are still made of maida (refined flour) and are full of unhealthy fats. They are not a health food.
    <br>
    <strong>"Multigrain" Bread:</strong> Look at the ingredients. If the first ingredient isn't "Whole Wheat Flour," it's probably just brown-colored white bread.
    <br>
    <strong>The Rule:</strong> Eat "whole" foods, not "processed" foods. An apple is a whole food. Apple juice is processed. Whole-wheat roti you make at home is a whole food. A packet of biscuits is highly processed. The less a food comes from a packet, the better it is for you.</p>

    <h4>3. <strong>Choose Healthy Fats</strong></h4>
    <p>Fats are not evil! They are essential for your body and for making food taste good. The key is the type.
    <br>
    <strong>Good Fats:</strong> Olive oil, avocado oil, nuts (almonds, walnuts), seeds (chia, flax), and fatty fish.
    <br>
    <strong>Bad Fats:</strong> Trans fats (found in fried foods, processed snacks, and vanaspati) and excessive saturated fats (ghee, butter, red meat). Use good fats, but use them in moderation.</p>
